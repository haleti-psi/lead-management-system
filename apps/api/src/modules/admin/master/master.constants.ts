/**
 * FR-131 — Master Configuration constants.
 *
 * The generic `/admin/{masterResource}` handler dispatches to one of the master
 * entities below. The allow-list deliberately EXCLUDES every resource that an
 * already-committed FR owns with its own concrete controller, to avoid a route
 * collision and respect the owner-writes rule (architecture §11.2):
 *
 *  - `users` / `roles` / `teams`      → FR-130  (`/admin/users`, `/admin/roles`, `/admin/teams`)
 *  - `product-configs`                → FR-040  (`/admin/products`, config_type `product_config`)
 *  - `sla-policies`                   → FR-104  (`/admin/sla-policies`, config_type `sla_policy`)
 *  - `schemes`                        → FR-042  (config_type `scheme`)
 *  - `allocation-rules`               → FR-030  (`/admin/allocation-rules`, M4 owner-writes)
 *  - `partners`                       → FR-090  (`/partners`, M10 PartnerService owner-writes)
 *  - `webhook-subscriptions`          → FR-140  (`/admin/webhooks`)
 *  - `break-glass`                    → FR-003  (`/admin/break-glass`)
 *
 * Each resource still funnels its create/update through the FR-132 governance
 * trail: the master row is written, a paired `configuration_versions(status='pending')`
 * row is created (maker-checker), a `CONFIG_CHANGED` outbox event is emitted, and
 * a `config_change` audit intent is appended — all in ONE UnitOfWork transaction.
